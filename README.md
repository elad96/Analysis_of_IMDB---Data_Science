In this project, we will analyze the data of IMDB (The Internet Movie Database) -
Website which provides information related to Movies, TV-shows, and Video games.
In our research we will focus at the information related to Films (Worldwide).
Due to the amount of data gathered over the years, we are hoping to find significant insights related to movies.

Our main research goal is:

In addition, we found those topics interesting as well:
- Which year was the best for movie production?”
- “Do user ratings similar to critics ratings?”
- “How long should a succesfull movie be?”
- ”Which genres people rate higher?”
